# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hey there! I‚Äôm Harsh, a software developer from Bengaluru, with a decade of experience, passionate about building cloud-native solutions and mentoring teams.<br><br>

* I‚Äôve spent over 10 years diving deep into Java and Spring, crafting high-performance applications that tackle real-world challenges.

* I learned designing and deploying cloud-native services on AWS, making the most of tools like Amazon EC2, Lambda, SQS, and RDS for scalability and reliability.

* With GitLab CI in my toolkit, I streamline deployment and automate testing, which means faster releases and better quality all around.

* I have constant exposure to Docker, Kubernetes & Terraform to manage cloud applications, and learning more modern ways as I progress.

* I have built & mentored many development teams, focusing on growth, productivity & thriving learning environment.

* I am enhancing skills in areas like scalable system architecture, high-availabability systems, microservices and design patterns.

Always eager to learn, I explore modern frameworks and learning to contribute in open-source projects.<br/>
In the future I am planning to learn about Android Application development & multi-platform application development.
